The *Efficient Terrain Generator for Apple II* is implemented in Apple II
using Kyan Pascal.

First you need a working Kyan Pascal environment:
* Use the latest Kyan Pascal for Apple II
* Make sure to read the manuals and be able to compile and run various Pascal examples
* Note: it is recommended to use the companion Kix OS as the environment

To run this program, 
* Copy this source folder `LORES` to your Kyan/Kix disk
* Follow the Kyan conventions to compile the source `TERRA.P`
* And execute the resulting `TERRA` binary
